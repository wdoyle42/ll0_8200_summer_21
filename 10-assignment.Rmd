Complete the following steps:

1. Using the counties dataset (`pd.Rdata`), create a model that predicts median household income (`median_hh_inc`).
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(glmnet)
```

```{r}
load("pd.RData")
```

```{r}
pd%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=median_hh_inc))+
  geom_density()

```


2. Provide the results of a 10-fold cross validation of your model. Describe what the results mean in a few clear sentences.

3. Provide the results of a 1000 repetition monte carlo validation with 10 percent (`p=.10`) leave out rate for the random partition. Describe what the results mean in a few clear sentences.
