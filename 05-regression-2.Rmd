## Introduction

In this section we're going to continue fitting regression to the training data and
testing the predictions against the testing data. We're also going to add some new elements.
We'll be using independent variables or predictor variables that are binary or categorical. In addition, we'll start using `workflows` that put the various steps of our modeling workflow together. 

We'll need the same libraries as last week:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(plotly)
```


And the same dataset, which includes data on a variety of metropolitan and micropolitan areas in the United States. 

```{r}
ad<-readRDS("area_data.Rds")
```


## Training and Testing Data

As before, I'm going to split the data into training and testing versions. 

```{r}
set.seed(35202)


split_data<-ad%>%initial_split(prop=.5)

ad_train<-training(split_data)

ad_test<-testing(split_data)
```

## Set Model

We're going to use the same linear model as last time, so I'll specify that here. 

```{r}
lm_fit <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  set_mode("regression")
```


## Begin Workflow

Now I start my workflow. A workflow is pretty much what it sounds like. It's a set of steps in a modeling process. To start with, let's add our model as defined above to the workflow. 

```{r}
income_wf<-workflow()%>%
  add_model(lm_fit)
```


## Regression with a binary variable

The next variable I want to include is `metro`, which is a binary variable set to "Yes" if the area is a metropolitan area and "No" if it is not a metropolitan area. The code below shows the number and proprtion of metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas in the dataset. 

```{r}
ad%>%
  group_by(metro)%>%
  summarise("Number of Areas"=n())%>%
  mutate(`Proportion`=`Number of Areas`/sum(`Number of Areas`))
```

This shows that about 58% of areas are not metro areas, while 42% are metro areas. 

## Set Formula

Next, I add the variable `metro` to the formula. 

```{r}
income_formula<-as.formula("income_75~college_educ+perc_homeown+metro")
```

The variable `metro` is now added to our formula. But we need to tell the model how to handle this variable, since it is a binary variable. 

## Set Recipe
```{r}
income_rec<-recipe(income_formula,data=ad)%>%
  step_dummy(metro)
```

The `recipe` function allows us to get the data ready for analysis, a step that is called [pre-processing](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-preprocessing-concepts-fa946d11c825). In the code above, I create a recipe from the formula and the dataset, then add a pre-processing step, `step_dummy`. This tells R that I want the metro variable to be understood as 0/1 variable. 

## Add recipe to workflow

We can now add the recipe to the previously existing workflow. 

```{r}
income_wf<-income_wf%>%
  add_recipe(income_rec)
```

## Fit to training data

Now we can fit the processed data to the training dataset and take a look at the results. 

```{r}
lm_results<-fit(income_wf,ad_train)

lm_results%>%
  tidy()

lm_results%>%
  pull_workflow_fit()%>%
  glance()

```

The `tidy` command allows us to see the coefficients from the model fit to the training data. 

The results show that the percent of individuals with incomes about $75,000 is `r tidy(lm_results)[4,2]` higher in metro areas than non-metro areas. This is really important: we always interpret binary variables as a comparison between the group that is set to 1 (metropolitan areas in this case) and the group that is set to 0 (non-metropolitan areas). 

## Predict on testing data and calculate rmse

We can add predictions to the testing dataset in the same way we did before. 

```{r}
ad_test<-
  predict(lm_results,ad_test)%>%
  rename(pred1=.pred)%>%
  bind_cols(ad_test)
```

## Calculate RMSE

Calculating rmse works the same as well. 

```{r}
rmse_1<-ad_test%>%rmse(truth=income_75,estimate=pred1)  
rmse_1
```

So, what we've done at this point is to include a new kind of predictor-- a binary variable-- and include it in a workflow that has both pre-processing and model fitting. 

## Regression with a categorical variable

We can also include categorical variables in our model using much the same process. 

## Set Formula
```{r}
income_formula<-as.formula("income_75~college_educ+perc_homeown+metro+region")
```


## Set Formula

To add a variable, the first thing we need to do is to set the formulat to include the new variable. 

```{r}
income_formula<-as.formula("income_75~college_educ+perc_homeown+metro+region")
```


## Set Recipe

Because our formula now includes two variables that are categorical, we need to change our recipe to reflect that. Below, `step_dummy` is applied to both the `metro` and `region` variables. 

```{r}
income_rec<-recipe(income_formula,data=ad)%>%
  step_dummy(metro,region)
```

## Update workflow with new recipe

Because we've already created the workflow `income_wf` we can update it with our new recipe, using the command `update_recipe`.

```{r}
income_wf<-income_wf%>%
  update_recipe(income_rec)
```

## Fit to training data and look at coefficients and model fit

Now we're ready to fit our linear model. The fit command below tells it to fit the model, with results stored in the object `lm_results`. We can then pipe the lm_results to the `tidy` command to see the coefficients. To see measures of model fit we can use `pull_workflow_fit` and then pipe those results to the `glance` command. 

```{r}
lm_results<-fit(income_wf,ad_train)

lm_results%>%
  tidy()

lm_results%>%
  pull_workflow_fit()%>%
  glance()

```

The results in this case show that the percent of individuals with incomes about \$75,000 is `r tidy(lm_results)[4,2]` higher in metro areas than non-metro areas. The results for region include results for three of the four regions. One region is excluded-- this is called the reference category. The way we interpret this is to say that the percent of individuals in the South with incomes above \$75,000 is predicted to be `r tidy(lm_results)[6,2]` percentage points lower than incomes of individuals in the Midwest. Where did the Midwest come from? It's the excluded category-- so all comparisons are made relative to it. For instance we would also say that the percent of individuals with incomes about \$75,000 is predicted to  be `r tidy(lm_results)[7,2]` higher for individuals in the West as compared with the Midwest. This is the key thing to remember about including categorical variables-- all comparisons are made relative to the reference category-- the excluded category. 

## Predict on testing data and calculate rmse

With our new variable included, we can do our normal steps of generating a prediction and adding it to the testing dataset. 

```{r}
ad_test<-
  predict(lm_results,ad_test)%>%
  rename(pred2=.pred)%>%
  bind_cols(ad_test)
```

## Calculate RMSE

With the data in the testing dataset, we can then generate the RMSE from our new model.

```{r}
rmse_2<-ad_test%>%rmse(truth=income_75,estimate=pred2)  
rmse_2
```

## Using `last_fit`

The `tidymodels` package has a function that automates the steps of running the model, generating predictions in the testing dataset and then generating metrics of model fit from the testing dataset. It's called `last_fit`. This accomplishes the same steps above, but does it all at once.

```{r}
lf<-last_fit(income_wf,split=split_data)
lf$.metrics
```

As you can see we get the same RMSE from last fit as when we did it "by hand."

## Last Note

Remember that we need to carefully distinguish between categorical variables and continuous variables when including them in our models. If we're using categorical variables we'll need to pre-process the data in order to let the model know that these variables should be included as categorical variables, with an excluded reference category.
