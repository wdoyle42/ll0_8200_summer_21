For this assignment, I want you to use the Census ACS API to download and plot data. Complete the following steps:

1. Scrape the data on GDP per capita by country from wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita
Turn this data into a data frame. 

2. Download the data on tertiary education in 2019 (first table) by country from wikipedia here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tertiary_education_attainment

Turn this data into a data frame.


3. Join the two data frames you created.


4. Plot gdp per capita (CIA version) as a function of the percent of the population aged 25-64 with a tertiary education. 




5. Model gdp per capita (using a linear model) as a function of the percent of the population aged 25-64 with a tertiary education.
