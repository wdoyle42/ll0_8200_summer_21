We'll be again working on a Kaggle-style competition to predict who gets pizza. Using the pizza dataset, find the best fit to the data. However, to qualify as a winner, you need to do the following: 

1. Fit a model using logistic regression using the training dataset.

2. Compute the predictions from your model from the testing dataset.

3. Calculate the AUC (from the Receiver Operating Characteristic) for the predictions from your model from the testing dataset.

4. Find a way to plot the predictions from your model.
