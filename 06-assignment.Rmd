Assignment 6
-----------------
Complete the following steps using the `els.Rdata`  file. I want you to use the `ggplot` library and commands for all plots. 

1.  Plot math scores as a function of a continuous independent variable.

3. Add a line of best fit to your graphic. 

4. Clean up the labeling and description of the graphic so that it could be presented to a broader audience. 

5. Now, run a regression predicting your outcome as a function of at least two independent variables.

6. Plot your predictions. Make this plot clearly labeled and easy to read.

7. In your .Rmd file, include a few sentences describing what the graphic above shows.
