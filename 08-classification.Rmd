Classification is the process of predicting group membership. Understanding which individuals are likely to be members of which groups is a key task for data scientists. For instance, most recommendation engines that are at the hear of consumer web sites are based on classification algorithms, predicting which consumers are likely to purchase which products. 

## Pizza

Today we'll be working with the pizza dataset, which comes from the subreddit random acts of pizza. Each line represents a post to this subreddit. We have various characteristics of these posts, along with the request text from the post itself. We'll use these characteristics of the posts to predict whether or not the poster received pizza. This lesson is inspired by [this article](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/download/8106/8101).

## Conditional Means as a Classifier

We'll start by generating some cross tabs and some quick plots, showing the probability of receiving pizza according to several characteristics of the post.  We start with a basic crosstab of the dependent variable. We use `prop.table` to change this from raw counts to proportions. I also provide a brief example of how to do a table using the `kable` function. 

```{r descriptives}
#Cross Tabs

za%>%
  count(got_pizza)%>% # Count numbers getting pizza
  mutate(p=prop.table(n))%>% #mutate for proportions using prop.table
  kable(format="markdown") # output to table

```

So, about 75% of the sample didn't get pizza, about 25% did. 

Next, we cross-tabulate receiving pizza with certain terms. First, if the request mentioned the word "student."

```{r}
za%>%
  group_by(student,got_pizza)%>%
  summarize(n=n())%>%
  mutate(prop=n/sum(n))%>%
  subset(select=c("student","got_pizza","prop"))%>%
  spread(got_pizza,prop)%>%
  kable()
```

Next, if the request mentioned the word "grateful."

```{r}

za%>%
  group_by(grateful,got_pizza)%>%
  summarize(n=n())%>%
  mutate(prop=n/sum(n))%>%
  subset(select=c("grateful","got_pizza","prop"))%>%
  spread(got_pizza,prop)%>%
  kable()

```

Crosstabs using binary data are equivalent to generating conditional means, as shown below. 

```{r condtional_means}
#Predictions using conditional means

za%>%
  group_by(grateful)%>%
  summarize(mean(got_pizza,na.rm=-TRUE))

```

We can also use conditional means to get proportions for very particular sets of characteristics. In this case, what about individuals who included some combination of the terms "grateful","student" and "poor" in their posts? 

```{r}
za%>%group_by(grateful,student)%>%summarize(mean(got_pizza))

za_sum<-za%>%
  group_by(grateful,student,poor)%>%
  summarize(mean_pizza=mean(got_pizza))

kable(za_sum)

```

## Probability of Receiving Pizza, Using Various Terms in Post
```{r}
gg<-ggplot(za_sum,aes(x=grateful,y=mean_pizza,fill=grateful))
gg<-gg+geom_bar(stat="identity")
gg<-gg+facet_wrap(~student+poor)
gg
```


## Logistic regression as a classifier

Logistic regression is set up to handle binary outcomes as the dependent variable. The downside to logistic regression is that it is modeling the log odds of the outcome, which means all of the coefficients are expressed as log odds, which no one understands intuitively. 

We're going to use the "tidymodels" approach to running this model, which works much better for a standard data science workflow. It begins with splitting the data into testing and training datasets using the `initial_split` function.  


```{r}
# Training and testing datasets

za_split<-initial_split(za,prop=.5)

za_train<-training(za_split)

za_test<-testing(za_split)

```


Next we set up the terms of the model.
```{r linear_model}
#  Model terms

za_formula<-as.formula("got_pizza_f~
             age+
             karma+
             total_posts+
             raop_posts+
             student+
             grateful+
             pop_request+
             score")

```

Next we'll set up the recipe.  Notice the use of a log function for total posts, which follow a classic exponential distribution. We use `offset=1` to  avoid attempting to take the log of 0.  

```{r}
logit_rec<-recipe(za_formula, data=za)%>%
  step_log(total_posts,offset = 1)
```


Now we're going to run the model. This approach is a little different than what we've been using up until now. We're going to create a `logit_mod` object by fitting a logistic regression to our outcome. The `set_engine` function says what particular kind of logistic regression we want to fit-- in this case we want to do classification

```{r}
logit_mod <- 
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm")%>%
  set_mode("classification")
```


## Put the workflow together

```{r}
logit_wf<-workflow()%>%
  add_recipe(logit_rec)%>%
  add_model(logit_mod)
```

```{r}
logit_results<-fit(logit_wf,data=za_train)
```

```{r}
logit_results%>%
  tidy()
```

With these results in hand we can generate predicted classifications. 

We can convert the predictions to a binary variable by setting a "threshold" of .5. Any prediction above .5 is considered to be a 1, anything below, a 0. We'll compare the actual "truth" of whether or not someone got a pizza with our prediction from the model using what's called a "confusion matrix" (really). 


```{r}
logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test)%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
  conf_mat(truth=got_pizza_f,estimate=.pred_class)
```


The confusion matrix generated here is explained [here](https://topepo.github.io/caret/measuring-performance.html#class). 


We're usually interested in three things: the overall accuracy of a classification is the proportion of cases accurately classified. The sensitivity is the proportion of "ones" that are accurately classified as ones-- it's the probability that a case classified as positive will indeed be positive. Specificity is the probability that a case classified as 0 will indeed be 0. 


## Accuracy: proportion correctly identifed
```{r}
logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test)%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
  metrics(truth=got_pizza_f,estimate=.pred_class)
```

## Sensitivity, probability of saying it's a Yes when it's really a yes
```{r}
logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test)%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
 sens(truth=got_pizza_f,estimate=.pred_class,event_level="second")

```

## Specificity, probability of saying it's a No when it's really a No
```{r}

logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test)%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
  spec(truth=got_pizza_f,estimate=.pred_class,event_level="second")

```



*Question: how do you get perfect specificity? How do you get 
perfect sensitivity?*


## Thresholds

As we vary the threshold from 0 to 1, the sensitivity will decrease, while the specificity will increase. The best models will be able to have both high sensitivity and specificty at an threshold. The code below shows what happens to sensitivity and specificity as thresholds go from 0 to 1. 

```{r}

th<-logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test,type="prob")%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
   threshold_perf(truth=got_pizza_f,
                 estimate=.pred_Yes,
                 thresholds=seq(0,1,by=.1),metrics=c("sens","spec"))

ggplot(filter(th,.metric%in%c("sens","spec")),
       aes(x=.threshold,y=.estimate,color=.metric))+
  geom_line()
  

```



## Area Under the Curve (AUC)

The area under the curve considers both the sensitivity (does the model accurately predict every positive outcome) with the specificity (does the model accurately predict every negative outcome) for a given model, and does so across every possible threshold value. 

```{r}

logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test,type="prob")%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
  roc_auc(truth=got_pizza_f,.estimate=.pred_Yes,event_level="second")
```



```{r}
logit_results%>%
  predict(za_test,type="prob")%>%
  bind_cols(za_test)%>%
  roc_curve(truth=got_pizza_f,.estimate=.pred_Yes,event_level="second")%>%
  autoplot()

```

## Use "last fit" to get same results.
```{r}
logit_final<-last_fit(logit_wf,za_split)

logit_final$.metrics
```




# Plotting results from logisitc regression

Because individual coefficients are so hard to understand, most of the time we convert the results to predicited probabilities, using a range of hypothetical values, as in the code below. 
```{r}
hypo_data<-za_train%>%data_grid(
  age=mean(age,na.rm=TRUE),
  karma=mean(karma,na.rm=TRUE),
  total_posts=mean(total_posts,na.rm=TRUE),
  raop_posts=seq_range(raop_posts,n=100),
  student=as_factor(levels(student)),
  grateful=as_factor(levels(grateful)[1]),
  pop_request=mean(pop_request,na.rm=TRUE),
  score=mean(score,na.rm=TRUE)
)

plot_data<-logit_results%>%
  predict(hypo_data,type="prob")%>%
  bind_cols(hypo_data)%>%
  rename(`Post Includes "Student"`=student)

plot_data%>%
ggplot(aes(x=raop_posts,y=.pred_Yes,color=`Post Includes "Student"`))+
  geom_line()+
  xlab("Number of Posts on RAOP")+
  ylab("Prob(Pizza)")

```
