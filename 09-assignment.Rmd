For this assignment, you'll be using the lemons dataset, which is a subset of the dataset used for a Kaggle competition described here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked/data. 
Complete the following steps:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(modelr)
```

```{r}
df<-read_csv("training.csv",n_max=1e6)
```


1. Using the lemons dataset, plot the probability of a car being a bad buy by make.

```{r}

df%>%
  group_by(Make)%>%
  summarize(mean_isbadbuy=mean(IsBadBuy,na.rm=TRUE))%>%
  mutate(Make=fct_reorder(Make,mean_isbadbuy))%>%
  ggplot(aes(y=mean_isbadbuy ,x=Make) )+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("Pr(Is Bad Buy)")+
  xlab("")
  
```


2. Create a table that shows the probability of a car being a bad buy by make.
3. Create a heatmap of the probability of a car being a bad buy by make and vehicle age. 
4. Create a plot of your choosing that shows the probability of a car being a bad buy by year and make.
