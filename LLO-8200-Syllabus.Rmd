## Introduction to Data Science

We have entered a time in which vast amounts of data are more widely available than ever before. At the same time, a new set of tools has been developed to analyze this data and provide decision makers with information to help them accomplish their goals. Those who engage with data and interpret it for organizational leaders have taken to calling themselves data scientists, and their craft data science. Other terms that have come into vogue are big data, predictive analytics, and data mining. These can seem to be mysterious domains. The point of this class is to demystify much of this endeavor for individuals who will be organizational leaders.
The class is structured around developing students' skills in three areas: getting data, analyzing data to make predictions, and presenting the results of analysis. For each area, the subtopics are as follows:

## Getting Data Topics

- Tools of the trade: R and RStudio
- Working with pre-processed data and flat files
- Getting data from the web: webscraping, using forms, using application programming interfaces

## Analyzing Data Topics

- Descriptives and conditional means
- Regression
- Supervised learning: classification
- Cross validation

## Presenting Data Analysis Topics
- Descriptives: histograms, density plots, bar plots, dot plots
- Scatterplots
- Lattice graphics and small multiples
- Interactive graphics
- Communicating results effectively

## Evaluation

Students will be evaluated based on two areas: weekly problem sets and the final project.

- Problem sets 65%: Each week students will be assigned a problem set to complete. The problem sets will be due 24 hours prior to the following week’s live session. For example, the Week 1 problem set will be due 24 hours prior to the Week 2 live session. Each problem set will be graded on a 100-point scale. Your lowest grade will be dropped.

There will be 10 assigned problem sets, with each problem set worth 100 points. The lowest grade will be dropped, meaning that you will be graded on 9 of these problem sets. The grading standards will be as follows:

50 = turned in problem set, did not attempt most of the problems

75 = turned in problem set, attempted most of the problems

100 = turned in problem set, attempted all of the problems

Note that your grade on problem sets does not depend on your being correct on all problems but simply making a serious attempt to answer all of the problems.

- Final Project 35%: During the course of the semester you will work on a final assignment utilizing your skills as a data analyst.
– Progress reports (4 total) 17.5%: 100 points each
– Final Product 17.5%: 100 points

There will be four progress reports for the final project, each worth 100 points. The progress reports will be due 24 hours prior to the week’s live session.  Students will be given the steps to complete each progress report.

There will be a final product asking the student to complete a data analysis. No late final products will be accepted. A rubric containing the relevant grading information for this final product will be supplied.

## Required Texts

We will have two texts for the course. The first is Hadley Wickham's book, R for Data Science:

Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: Import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. San Francisco, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc.

The other text is Nate Silver's Signal and the Noise:

Silver, N. (2012). The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail—but some don’t. New York, NY: Penguin.

## Software
 
We will use only free, open-source software in this course.

We will use R, an open-source data analytic platform for all analysis. R appears to be the most widely used data analysis software in data science. We will utilize RStudio as our integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

## Honor Code Statement

All assignments for this class, including weekly problem sets and the final project, are to be conducted under the obligations set out in Vanderbilt's Honor Code. [Please click here to review the Honor Code](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/).

There will be two quite different standards for completing the problem sets and the final project.

Problem sets. You may collaborate with anyone, and you may utilize any resource you wish to complete these problem sets.

Final Project. All of the work on the final assignment must be your own. Anyone's work that you reference should be cited as usual. All data that you do not personally collect must be cited, as with any other resource.

If you have any questions at all about the Honor Code or how it will be applied, ask me right away.
